# my conf
This repo stores my configuration settings for Emacs & bash under Linux and Mac OS X.

TDB: Create links to files in here, etc...
TDB: Stores init files, utility scripts, etc...

For example, in my Ubuntu 14.04 machine I have:

    etomort@elx306b6vv:~$ cat .bash_aliases
    . ~/conf/linux_alias

    etomort@elx306b6vv:~$ tail -3 .bashrc
    # --- my conf
    . ~/conf/linux_env
    . ~/conf/persistent_history
