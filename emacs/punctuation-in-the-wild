New keys: ':', '?', ''', '"', '!', '-'. That's awesome!
Congratulations -- did you think it'd be so easy? Yes? No? Maybe?
I'll bet it was "a walk in the park."
Unfortunately, many people don't learn to "properly" type these keys;
that's a shame because - even though they aren't letters -
they're used so frequently!
Don't you agree? Review and/or repeat this lesson, if necessary,
