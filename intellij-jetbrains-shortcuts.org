  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "IntelliJ doesn't like it when you type fast. Its completions can't keep up and you wind up with half-identifiers everywhere."

    As the Emacs config guru that you are, I'm half-surprised to see you didn't tick that feature off of IntelliJ's config.

    Preferences -> Editor -> General -> Code Completion -> Autopopup

    Or, quicker: C-S-a, then type "autopopup", Enter

    BTW it was so nice to read you again :)
