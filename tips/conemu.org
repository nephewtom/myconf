* Workaround for copying and scrolling very slow:
  https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1413
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Hold shift down and single click the start of the text you want highlighted.
Now, while still holding down shift, scroll down:
- with PageDown or PageUp keys
- or using the mouse scroll button (a bit more difficult)

and single click the end of the text you want highlighted.
The key is to not click and DRAG the mouse.
